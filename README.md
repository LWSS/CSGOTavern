# CSGOTavern
CSGOTavern is a Market Site for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in-game Items.


Made with PHP 5.x / Laravel 5 
Requires Cartalyst ( https://cartalyst.com/ )
Uses CSGOTavern-Bot for the items ( https://github.com/LWSS/CSGOTavern-Bot ) 

Old project I worked on from late 2015 -> early 2016.

Was never released, however.

Currently needs a payment system. Was using Stripe, but ripped it out. 

Note: Uses the now defunct CSGO API ( http://api.steampowered.com/IEconItems_730/ )


Code Licensed under MIT. However, it would be cool if you put that you used my code somewhere on your site.
